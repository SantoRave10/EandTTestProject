<p>In a news post, Facebook’s head of news feed Adam Mosseri said the platform would be deprioritising the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands in favour of posts that “inspire back-and-forth discussion”.</p>
 <p>He also said that post from friends and family would take greater prominence on the news feed than they currently are.</p>
 <p>Some recent trials saw all content from liked ‘Pages’ moved to a new tab called the Explore Tab. But the new format will see page posts still appear in the News Feed, although there may be fewer of them.</p>
 <p>Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the changes would be the start of a series of alterations to the design of the world’s largest social network.</p>
 <p>Facebook, which owns four of the world’s most popular smartphone apps including Instagram, has for years prioritised material that its complex computer algorithms think people will engage with through comments, ‘likes’ or other ways of showing interest.</p>
 <p>Zuckerberg, the company’s 33-year-old co-founder, said that would no longer be the goal.</p>
 <p>“I’m changing the goal I give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions,” Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
 <p>The shift was likely to mean that the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement would go down in the short term, he wrote, but he added it would be better for users and for the business over the long term.</p>
 <p>Advertising on the social network would be unaffected by the changes, John Hegeman, a Facebook vice-president, said in an interview.</p>
 <p>Facebook and its social media competitors have been inundated by criticism that their products reinforce users’ views on social and political issues and lead to addictive viewing habits, raising questions about possible regulation and the businesses’ long-term viability.</p>
 <p>The company has been criticised for algorithms that may have prioritised misleading news and misinformation in people’s feeds, influencing the 2016 American presidential election, as well as political discourse in many countries.</p>
 <p>Last year, Facebook disclosed that Russian agents had used the network to spread inflammatory posts to polarise the American electorate.</p>
 <p>Congress is expected to hold more hearings this month, questioning the role social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube play in spreading propaganda.</p>
 <p>Zuckerberg said an overhaul of the company’s products, beginning with changes to the algorithms that control the News Feed, would help to address those concerns. Similar changes will be made to other products in the coming months, he said.</p>
 <p>“We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren’t just fun to use, but also good for people’s well-being,” Zuckerberg wrote.</p>
 <p>With more than 2 billion monthly users, Facebook is the world’s largest social media network. It is also among the world’s largest corporations, reporting $36bn in revenue, mostly from advertising, during the 12 months that ended on 30 September.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>When the First World War broke out in 1914, women had already been studying science and engineering at British universities for nearly half a century, often very successfully and usually thanks to a level of dogged persistence that meant they often outshone their male classmates. </p>
 <p>While most Cambridge colleges retain records of things that students and graduates accomplished on the battlefield during the conflict, and those who didn’t return, Newnham College is unusual in that being an all-female college the hand-made book ‘War Work, 1914-1918’, which records the activities of around 600 members of various ages, has some very different stories to tell.</p>
 <p>Inscribed in the book’s embroidered linen covers are the details of doctors who operated at the front, chemists who developed explosives and poison gases, biologists who researched into tropical diseases and mathematicians responsible for intelligence work. The list is a snapshot of just one group of women for whom the departure of men from their regular occupations created opportunities in industry beyond the usual option of teaching.</p>
 <figure class="article-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5328/a-lab-of-ones-own-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&rnd=131602414910000000"> <source media="(min-width: 960px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5328/a-lab-of-ones-own-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131602414910000000"> <source media="(min-width 760px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5328/a-lab-of-ones-own-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=640&rnd=131602414910000000"> <source media="(min-width 320px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5328/a-lab-of-ones-own-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=320&rnd=131602414910000000"> <!-- fallback image for non supporting browsers --> <img class="img-responsive lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="/media/5328/a-lab-of-ones-own-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131602414910000000" /> </picture> </figure>
 <p>As Patricia Fara, a Cambridge lecturer and president of the British Society for the History of Science, explains at the start of <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-lab-of-ones-own-9780198794981" target="_blank">‘A Lab of One’s Own: Science and Suffrage in the First World War’</a> (Oxford University Press, £18.99, ISBN 9780198794981), it was the realisation of how few names in ‘War Work’ she recognised that prompted her to find out more about these scientific pioneers whose stories have often fallen into a gap between social histories of how women moved into manual roles in factories during the war and the ambulance drivers, nurses, bus conductors, farmers and factory workers who “effectively ran Britain for four years while [the men] were away”.</p>
 <p>As well as suffragists such as Virginia Woolf’s sister, Ray Strachey, who had aligned themselves with scientific and technological progress prior to the war and mobilised women to enter conventionally male domains such as science and medicine, Fara tells the stories of some of the many others including mental health pioneer Isabel Emslie, chemist Martha Whiteley, and botanist Helen Gwynne Vaughan.</p>
 <p>The story doesn’t have an altogether happy ending. Many historians now acknowledge that although the war provided a temporary opening up of roles that had been denied to women, the return of millions of men to work from 1918 on saw a reversion to traditional roles. Soaring unemployment in the 1920s saw men given priority for the jobs that were available. However, the bravery of these pioneer women scientists, temporarily allowed into a closed world before the door clanged shut again, paved the way for today’s women scientists.</p>
 <p>‘A Lab of One’s Own’ is packed with stories of women who deserve greater recognition. More than that though, it resonates with current trends in how women are treated in the workplace even a century after the partial suffrage of 1918. The idea that for ten years women could only vote if they were 30, owned property or were graduates seems ridiculously archaic now, yet some will recognise there’s still more to do.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Section 702, a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), allows the NSA to collect online communications from foreign nationals and US citizens’ communication with foreign nationals.</p>
 <p>The extent of this program was made public following the huge leak of NSA documents to the international media by Edward Snowden, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee and NSA contractor. These documents revealed that the NSA could collect emails and other communications without a warrant through upstream and downstream surveillance. This had been practised and the content searched. The NSA was also found to have secretly accessed Google and Yahoo data centres to collect hundreds of millions of users’ data, tracked the online sexual activity of “radicalisers”, and spied on charities, world leaders and even users of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Second Life</em>.</p>
 <p>Other agencies of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance were implicated in these leaks, including the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).</p>
 <p>Following Snowden’s leaks, the US government began to publish annual transparency reports about the use of surveillance tools.</p>
 <p>Last renewed in 2012, Section 702 was due to expire on January 19, but the likely passing of the bill will allow for warrantless internet surveillance to continue until 2023. Some representatives attempted before the vote to get support for an amendment which would require the acquisition of a warrant to read a US citizen’s incidentally-collected data.</p>
 <p>“You pass this amendment [and] we are flying blind in our fight against terrorists,” said Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House. “The consequences are really high.”</p>
 <p>In the end, Representatives voted 256-164 in favour of renewing the program, with the vote mainly split along party lines and largely backed by Republicans. Next, it will require the approval of the Senate and White House. Despite threats by both Democratic and Republican Senators to filibuster the bill, it is expected to proceed without any serious setbacks.</p>
 <p>According to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader: “The intelligence community and the Justice Department depend on these vital authorities to protect the homeland and keep Americans safe.”</p>
 <p>James Comey, who served as director of the Federal Bureay of Investigation (FBI) until his dismissal by President Donald Trump in May 2017, tweeted his support for the program, describing it as a “vital and carefully overseen tool to protect this country”.</p>
 <p>However, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/house-fails-protect-americans-unconstitutional-nsa-surveillance">a blog post</a> by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which campaigns for online privacy, criticised the decision: “Because of these votes, broad NSA surveillance of the internet will likely continue, and the government will still have access to Americans’ emails, chat logs, and browsing history without a warrant. Because of these votes, this surveillance will continue to operate in a dark corner, routinely violating the Fourth Amendment and other core constitutional protections.”</p>
 <p>Confusion was caused before the vote due to tweets posted by President Donald Trump, which appeared to express scepticism towards Section 702, due to claims that the program may have been used against him by the Obama administration to spy on his 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
 <p>“This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?” Trump tweeted. The “phony dossier” is a reference to a dossier of unsubstantiated incriminating and embarrassing material about Trump gathered from Russian sources.</p>
 <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-ping-pong-on-surveillance-law-sets-off-a-101-minute-scramble/2018/01/11/748026ec-f6ef-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.0904e58de212">According to the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, following Trump's Tweet, Speaker Ryan spent 30 minutes on the phone explaining the difference between domestic and foreign surveillance to the president.</p>
 <p>Later, the President added: “With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process [by which US citizens mentioned in intelligence reports may be deanonymised] since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!”</p>
 <p>Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary, dismissed reporters’ questions about the Trump’s self-contradictory Tweets at a press briefing. “It wasn’t confusing to me, I’m sorry if it was for you,” she said.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Although late to the hardware game, the search giant has been increasingly focusing its sights on gadgets, releasing a range of Google-branded smartphones, smart speakers and streaming devices in the past few years. <a href="https://blog.google/topics/hardware/the-best-hardware-software-and-ai-together/">According to Rick Osterloh</a>, senior vice-president for hardware, Google's gadgets are a combination of sophisticated hardware, software and artificial intelligence.</p>
 <p>In 2017, the tech giant began its $1.1 billion (£810 million) takeover of the HTC Pixel team; in doing so it absorbed 2000 employees, many of whom had worked on the development of Google’s Pixel smartphone model. The acquisition was interpreted as a signal that Google is determined to mark out a significant place in the smartphone market.</p>
 <p>Now, <em>Bloomberg </em>has reported that Google acquired a UK-based start-up, Redux, through an Ireland-based subsidiary in August 2017.</p>
 <p>The Cambridge-based start-up was working to make screens function as loudspeakers, as well as developing more sophisticated haptic feedback technology. Following its acquisition – through an Ireland-based subsidiary of Google – it closed its own website.</p>
 <div class="social-embed-outer clearfix"> <div class="social-embed-inner"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Redux tech turns the screen into a speaker, and a haptic surface. Trying it out here. The sound is actually coming from the screen. <a href="https://t.co/VPAi6TzKk9">pic.twitter.com/VPAi6TzKk9</a></p>&mdash; Stan Schroeder (@franticnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/franticnews/status/836570419243155456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
 <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> </div>
 <p>“Redux allows manufacturers to make all kinds of devices more usable, responsive, versatile, discreet and robust,” the now-archived website said.</p>
 <p>The start-up had an intellectual property base of more than 170 patents. It used small actuators to cause screens to vibrate, effectively transforming them into speakers. The start-up had already demonstrated this technology in PCs and infotainment systems, and was beginning to move to bringing the technology to smartphones and tablets.</p>
 <p>Redux was reportedly planning to roll out its haptic sound technology in phones beginning in 2018.</p>
 <p>If Google is able to use this technology in their own phones, it could free up a certain amount of space in their phones currently used for microspeakers. This space could either be used for larger batteries and other hardware, or to reduce the thickness of their phones further. Redux’s expertise could also be used to develop better sound for Google’s other hardware, such as its Google Home smart speaker.</p>

d rubbish everywhere, destroying the planet, and now we’ve turned our destructive urges towards Space. Over the years we’ve irresponsibly dumped so much crap up there that the likelihood that it will smash into satellites and other spacecraft we send up is growing exponentially.</p>
 <p>In addition, the more space junk that orbits the Earth, the more it collides with itself, smashing into thousands of smaller pieces. You would think that smaller pieces would actually be a good thing, how much damage can a tiny piece of old rocket actually do? Well it turns out that the ISS got hit by a paint fleck which almost took out one of its windows.</p>
 <p>You see these tiny pieces of space debris are travelling at such speeds that they’re equivalent to a barrage of bullets constantly circling the Earth. They are also much harder to capture and remove from orbit. Eventually we might end up hemming ourselves in so that we are unable to launch anything into space without it getting smashed into smithereens. Just in case you were worried that we weren’t causing enough environmental damage on Earth, you can now rest assured that we treat Space just as badly.</p>

 <h3><a href="/content/articles/2018/01/should-gaming-addiction-be-diagnosed-as-a-medical-condition/" target="_blank">Should gaming disorder become a psychiatric diagnosis?</a></h3>
 <p>There’s some classic ivory tower bickering going on between the lines of this report from E&amp;T reporter Hilary Lamb. The questions at its heart are twofold. Could playing lots of video games be a sign of a psychiatric disease? Can gaming become an addiction? Yes, says the World Health Organisation. No, say dozens of experts.</p>
 <p>I’m naturally sceptical about the rush to medicalise, but then what do I know? I’m lucky never to have suffered from any mental health problem (as far as I know), but I like to think I wouldn’t be ashamed to admit it if I had been diagnosed with one. These are medical problems like any other. They can be every bit as bad as, and sometimes much worse than, physical diseases.</p>
 <p>I certainly don’t think I’m immune, and I don’t mean to sound dismissive of anyone. My issue is simply with the sheer number of recognised mental health disorders, with one often seemingly indistinguishable from the next.</p>
 <p>The NHS lists scores of different forms of psychiatric disease. There are subcategories too. They include panic disorder, anxiety, stress, depression, hoarding disorder, antisocial personality disorder, social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. Maybe it helps for patients to be able to put a name to a problem, but I for one am unsure as to exactly when anxiety becomes stress and at what point antisocial personality disorder morphs into social anxiety disorder.</p>
 <p>I’m not sure adding new names to an already lengthy list to describe conditions that are only very subtly different from those already classified actually helps anyone.</p>
 <p>The health service loves a good syndrome, though. A particular favourite, outside of the arena of mental health, is ‘shaken baby syndrome’. This odd phrase is now used to describe what happens to the brain and head of an infant that has been violently shaken by its abusive parent or carer and possibly hit against a wall. It’s not a discrete medical ‘syndrome’, for goodness sake, it’s brain damage caused by a violent assault on a child!</p>
 <p>Anyway, back to gaming addiction. I am unqualified to opine as to whether this should be included in the WHO’s manual alongside the likes of alcoholism and heroin addiction. Maybe we should add social media addiction too. And online news addiction. And selfie-at-a-tourist-hotspot addiction.</p>
 <p>But this much I am sure of: if we are going to keep on making this list of syndromes and diseases longer and longer, let’s at least agree on how to identify, differentiate and, hopefully, treat any new entries. Otherwise in a few decades’ time the list will be so long that everyone will just ignore it.</p>

 <p>As the ban on microbeads came into force this week, the government announced a 25 year plan to eliminate avoidable plastic waste. The plan came under fire for it's 2042 target 25 years away. in plastics, plenty changed from the 1850s to the 1970s. Think think how much has changed technologically in the last 25 years, let alone how that will accelerate in the next 25. There's a new fund for 'plastics innovation' research but the government audit committee that recommended the microbeads ban were also disappointed the new plan did not include its other recommendations, such as a levy on disposable coffee cups </p>

 <p>I’ve always been impervious to the appeal of firework displays, whether it’s the ear-splitting whizzes and bangs that seem to last for at least a fortnight around 5 November every year or the recent trend for seeing in the new year by letting off a few rockets in your back garden. That’s not to say I’d put a stop to them altogether; plenty of people seem to enjoy standing in the freezing November night, craning their neck to watch the bright lights and noisy explosions. What I can see the appeal of though, having witnessed it for the first time while on holiday last summer, is an aerobatic display by a team like the RAF’s Red Arrows. Maybe it’s the fact there’s a high level of skill involved, and potentially an element of danger.</p>
 <p>The way forward looks like it might combine the best of both worlds. One of the highlights of this week’s CES consumer technology show in Las Vegas was a performance by pre-programmed, illuminated mini drones. In theory, the 250 craft involved could just be the start – as the technology develops it should be possible to have many more buzzing around in a co-ordinated routine as the crown ooh and aah below. That I’d be interested in going outside to see whatever the weather. And unlike fireworks they could be used over and over again.</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p>A very welcome piece of news for someone like myself, whose life was saved at least twice by antibiotics. The first time was many years ago, in rural Ukraine, where I was laid up with severe pneumonia and pleuritic fever. I was coughing up blood, my body temperature reached 42 degrees, and I would almost certainly have died had a village nurse not found some penicillin in her medicine cupboard. The second was last April, when hospitalised at Lister Hospital in Stevenage with a severe and at that point unidentifiable chest infection while recovering after open-heart surgery. For five days almost non-stop, my veins were pumped with strong antibiotic solutions from two drips that I monikered Dee and Doris. It was only on day six, when everyone, myself included, was ready to give up,  that the antibiotics started working, for, like with most of us,  because of using that type of drugs much too frequently throughout the years - to treat flus, colds and toothaches - my body’s resistance to them had increased considerably. In recent years the media has been spreading fears of the situation when our bodies will stop reacting to antibiotics completely – a truly apocalyptic scenario for humankind.  If administering these drugs through patches does  help reduce our resistance to them, then this is a breakthrough worthy of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, for it can potentially save millions and millions of human lives.</p>

<p>For passengers who cannot open doors, the Cruise AV - a rebranded version of GM’s Chevrolet Bolt EV - has even been designed to perform that task. It will have other accommodations for hearing and visually impaired customers.</p>
 <p>GM believes the vehicle will actually prove to be safer than those driven by humans.</p>
 <p>“Imagine a world with no car crashes,” the company said in a statement. “Our self-driving vehicles aim to eliminate human driver error — the primary cause of 94 per cent of crashes — leading to fewer injuries and fatalities.”</p>
 <p>It was also keen to point out that its driverless vehicles should prove to be more environmentally friendly than traditional cars.</p>
 <p>“Our self-driving vehicles will all be electric, contributing to a better environment,” GM said.</p>
 <p>This will be one of the first self-driving vehicles in commercial passenger service and among the first to do away with manual controls for steering, brakes and throttle. <span>Doing away with the driver’s seat in the Cruise AV will also allow an extra passenger to fit into the vehicle, maximising its capacity.</span></p>

 <p>Company President Dan Ammann told reporters GM had filed on Thursday for government approval to deploy the “first production-ready vehicle designed from the start without a steering wheel, pedals or other unnecessary manual controls.”</p>
 <p>GM is part of a growing throng of vehicle manufacturers, technology companies and tech startups seeking to develop so-called robo-taxis over the next three years in North America, Europe and Asia. Most of those companies have one or more partners.</p>
 <p>Earlier this week Ford said it plans to partner with delivery service Postmates as the automaker starts testing ways to transport people, food and packages this spring in its self-driving cars, which are being developed by Ford’s Argo unit.</p>
 <p>Other companies - from Uber to Alphabet's Waymo - have been testing self-driving vehicle prototypes in limited ride sharing applications, but have been less explicit than GM in announcing plans for commercial robo-taxi services.</p>
 <p>GM executives said the automaker has asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow 16 alterations to existing vehicle safety rules - such as having an airbag in what would normally be the driver’s seat, but without a steering wheel - to enable the deployment of the Cruise AV.</p>
 <p>The automaker would then need to obtain similar approval from individual US states. GM executives said seven US states already allow the alterations sought by the automaker. In other states - including those that stipulate a car must have a licensed human driver - GM will work with regulators to change or get a waiver from existing rules.</p>
 <p>The company declined to identify the first states in which it plans to launch the vehicle or say when it would begin testing.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>As often happens, New Year brings with it both good and bad news.</p>
 <p>As I have just visited South Korea (and, very briefly, North Korea too by standing for  a minute or so on the wrong, northern, side of the border demarcation line while in the Demilitarized Zone – read more about it in my feature due to appear in the March 2018 issue of E&amp;T), the sudden news of long-awaited and long-delayed bilateral negotiations between the two sides, and North Korea’s participation in the forthcoming Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang came as a welcome New Year surprise. It was almost a personal gift, for while in Korea I came to seriously like the country, its people, its technology and its food!</p>
 <p>Let’s hope that this is just the first step on the long road to reconciliation, and, who knows, maybe even reunification of two Koreas.</p>
 <p>I first discovered Korea as a schoolkid in the USSR, thanks to a glossy propaganda monthly <em>Koreya Segodnya</em> (<em>Korea Today</em>), published, no doubt,  in the communist North. That bulky magazine, printed in stilted Russian, was occasionally on sale in the 1960s and 1970s Soviet Union. For all its inane totalitarian contents, it was always in high demand, and we had to ‘bribe’ an old woman seller in a newspaper kiosk next to our school by letting her throw in a couple of back copies of our own compulsory, yet not-at-all popular, <em>Pravda</em> newspaper.</p>
 <p>What was the attraction of  the countless pictures of the ‘Great Leader Kim Il Sung’, with captions like, “The Great Leader helps an old lady to cross the road”, “The Great leader gives on-the-spot guidance to Korean scientists and engineers,” and “The Great Leader attends the performance of the opera ‘Great Leader’s Five-Point Programme of Modernising Korean Agriculture” (big yawn)? Or of the blunt assertion that as a student ‘the Great Leader’ wrote and published 1500 (!) books in just three years?</p>
 <p>To us, <em>Koreya Segodnya</em> was irresistible, however.  It was vitally important to know that there were people in the world more enslaved and more oppressed that we were and were living under the regime even more cruel and absurd than ours. Leafing through those bombastic pages, made us feel a bit more like free human beings, for after a quick browse of <em>Korea Today</em>, the same <em>Pravda</em> newspaper would read like a thriller.</p>
 <p>Of course, I had no idea then that not all of Korea was that backward and oppressed, that alongside the long suffering North, there existed a prosperous and ever-growing capitalist South.</p>
 <p>The bad news was the death of Peter Preston, formerly the editor of the <em>Guardian</em>, who was also a friend. A brilliant writer and editor, a very courageous man, who had been a polio victim in his childhood and had to put up with a resulting disability all his life, and an inveterate pipe smoker, he was the first to greet me in the old Farringdon Road <em>Guardian</em> offices, when I arrived there in 1988 on a short working attachment from Moscow. I was of course extremely nervous, because, firstly, I was not sure if I was up to writing – in English! – for one of the world’s best newspapers, and, secondly, was nearly paralysed with fear at the sight of the first ever personal computer on which I was supposed to type my copy prior to filing it. Puffing ceaselessly at his pipe, Peter said some reassuring words that immediately made me feel welcome and at ease.</p>
 <p>I ended up publishing a dozen or so stories, features and book reviews in the <em>Guardian</em> in the course of three weeks. (Yet, in all honesty, I didn't master the PC, and had to dictate my hand-scribbled copy to some compassionate female colleagues who had kindly agreed to put it on screen for me).</p>
 <p>A couple of years later I defected from the USSR and, while continuing writing for the <em>Guardian</em>, ended up working as a journalist in Australia. It was there that I was invited to join the IPI – the International Press Institute , a global network of journalists, editors and media executives of which Peter was a member too. The IPI conducted annual gatherings in different parts of the world, and I remember meeting up with Peter in Venice, Istanbul and some other places. As a senior colleague and friend, he always took genuine interest in my life and supported me in my decision to move back to the UK in 1992. I kept following his post-editor career as a columnist and writer very closely and will miss him a lot. Rest in peace, Peter.</p>
 <p>Life nevertheless goes on. In the last days of 2017 and the first of 2018, I had a couple of rather discouraging encounters with technology starting with some old audio cassettes of the BBC’s Russian Course ‘Exercises and Dialogues’, recorded probably well over 20 years ago. Here I foresee a couple of questions. 1. What use can ancient audio tapes have in our age of online streaming and Spotify? 2. Why on earth did I need to learn Russian when it was and remains my first and only mother tongue? Or have I gone senile to the extent that all Russian words, apart from ‘da’, ‘niet’ and ‘vodka’, have been erased from my long suffering memory?</p>
 <p>Here are the answers. 1. I use only audio cassettes in my car – a 16-year-old Fiat Punto equipped with a cassette player – a fact that justifies the true meaning of its number plate – HEX (the curse). 2. It was not I but my daughter who was trying to learn Russian using the audio cassettes I found in the boot of my car among the curly with age tapes of ABBA and James Last’s orchestra.   </p>
 <p>As I was driving, or rather crawling, along a pre-Christmas M25 which at that time of the year comes to resemble a large and generous Christmas stocking, filled to the brim with multi-coloured cars instead of sweets and chocolates, I was getting increasingly disturbed by the sounds reaching me from both the player and from the passenger seat on my left. It was the following dialogue, first read (in Russian) by the presenters, and then duly repeated by my daughter:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><em>Eto Papa?</em></li>
 <li><em> Eto ne Papa. Eto vino</em>!</li>
 </ul>
 <p> Or, in English translation:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Is this Daddy?</li>
 <li>No, this is not Daddy. This is wine!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>My first thought was that my daughter was trying to tease me hinting at the large amounts of Barossa Valley Merlot I consumed last night with dinner. But the Russian dialogue went on:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Is this Mummy?</li>
 <li>No, this is not Mummy. This is theatre!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>At least, they were a bit kinder to Mummy and not assuming she had a resemblance to an alcoholic drink…</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Is this Grandad??</li>
 <li>No, this is not Granddad, this is a post office!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>At that point, I started thinking that being mistaken for a glass of wine is not necessarily the worst kind of scenario.</p>
 <p>Before I or my daughter could find out what Grandma was going to be confused with (a car park? a plate of porridge?), I snatched the cassette out of the player and chucked it out of the window. I then reminded my puzzled daughter about the spoof phrase book, invented and ridiculed by the Serbian playwright and satirist Branislav Nusic, who suggested the following sentences for diligent foreign language learners: “Have you seen my Uncle’s knife?” and “Don’t you think, dear, that the man over there is kinder than that woman in a shawl – and that he will give us more alms than she will?”</p>
 <p>Well, to be fair, technology had little to do with the plain stupid dialogues, quoted above, apart from playing them that is. I wish I could say the same about my recent acquisition, or rather a Christmas present from my wife, in the shape of a Google Home Mini – a grey round blob the size and then shape of a large pebble - which I first took for a decoration and placed onto the Christmas tree.</p>
 <p>I soon discovered, however, that the blob could talk. And with a pleasant and sexy woman’s voice too! It (she) could promptly respond to questions and commands, and we spent the whole evening tormenting the poor little gadget with queries like: “How many teeth do puppies have?”, “What’s the weather like in Rio de Janeiro?” and “What kind of sound do aardvarks make?” She of course knew all the answers. Even when my daughter asked rather cheekily if the blob had a boyfriend, the reply came straight away: “I am still searching!” Ha ha ha!</p>
 <p>In short, I started slowly but surely falling in love with my Google Mini and couldn’t wait to run downstairs (where it/she lived) in the morning to be wished a nice day by her/it.</p>
 <p>As it often happens in real life, however, my joy was destined to be short lived.</p>
 <p>The first shock came when I realised that she/it didn’t even recognise me. True, she could recite my whole biography and bibliography from the Wikipedia article, but when I asked her/it: “What’s my name?,” the reply was: “Christine!” which is my wife's name!</p>
 <p>It turned out that since it was activated via my wife’s iPhone, the blob was bound to think (if only she/it  could think at all) that anyone who spoke with it/her was called Christine. She/it was obviously unable to tell a man’s voice (even a nice loud baritone like mine) from a woman’s!</p>
 <p>Yet the real blow came yesterday, which was actually my birthday. When we returned home after an evening out in London and duly asked Google Mini what the weather was going to be like the following morning, she/it suddenly burst into reading our list of... (you won’t believe it, but I swear on my life – and on my afterlife too - it is true) local undertakers and funeral parlours! The last thing an overweight man in his sixties, still recovering after open-heart surgery, wants to hear on his birthday!!</p>
 <p>I am not superstitious, however, and am not going to bear a grudge against it/her, for after all, it/she is not much more than a house pet who talks back. Instead, I will ask my Google Mini about the weather in Budapest next week (just did: it will be cold – from minus 5 to minus 1).</p>
 <p>Why Budapest? Because it is where I am heading this coming Saturday for yet another encounter with technology, or rather, with engineering. Dental engineering. Yes, my lovely dental implants, beautifully engineered and installed in my mouth in the Budapest-based SmileSavers Clinic last May, need attention, read adjustment. Like many other quality products of precision engineering, they are subject to a 3-year-long warrant, so will be fixed for free. They call it ‘dental holiday’ and send you an ‘itinerary’ instead of the list of your dental appointments. Well, compared to my first SmileSavers experience precisely a year ago, when all my 13 remaining teeth had to removed first to clear space for the implants, this coming visit promises to be, if not quite a holiday, then a relatively easy ride indeed (fingers crossed). Even if I am going to end up temporarily toothless for an evening or two (to allow the hard working SmileSavers technicians to spend some time alone with my implants, i.e. to fix them properly and unhurriedly in the privacy of their workshop overnight), I should be OK in Budapest, with plenty of the world-famous ‘ruin’ pubs and bars (i.e. pubs and bars situated in some picturesquely ruined and semi-ruined buildings). A liquid supper, or a no-less-liquid dinner, would not be entirely out of order.</p>
 <p>I will tell you about my new dental engineering adventures in a future View from Vitalia. In the meantime, you could catch up with my previous ones by listening to the BBC Radio 4 programme ‘Life of Dental Losses’, which was repeated on Radio 4 on Thursday 4 January and is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08hpwbg" target="_blank">still available to listen to on the BBC website</a>.</p>
 <p>Wish me luck!</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In an experiment called Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT), they showed that millisecond pulsars could be used to accurately determine the location of an object moving at thousands of miles per hour in space.</p>
 <p>It works in a similar fashion to the GPS system that provides positioning, navigation, and timing services to users on Earth with a constellation of 24 operating satellites.</p>
 <p>“This demonstration is a breakthrough for future deep-space exploration,” said SEXTANT project manager Jason Mitchell, an aerospace technologist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Centre. “As the first to demonstrate X-ray navigation fully autonomously and in real-time in space, we are now leading the way.”</p>
 <p>This technology provides a new option for deep-space navigation that could work in concert with existing spacecraft-based radio and optical systems.</p>
 <p>Although it could take a few years to develop an X-ray navigation system that is practical for use on deep-space spacecraft, eventually it will allow them to autonomously determine their locations outside the currently used Earth-based global navigation networks.</p>
 <p>“We’re doing very cool science and using the space station as a platform to execute that science, which in turn enables X-ray navigation,” said Goddard’s Keith Gendreau. “The technology will help humanity navigate and explore the galaxy.”</p>
 <p>NICER, a Nasa observatory about the size of a washing machine that was installed on the International Space Station last year, is currently is studying neutron stars and their rapidly pulsating cohort, called pulsars.</p>
 <p>Although these stellar oddities emit radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, observing in the X-ray band offers the greatest insights into these unusual, incredibly dense celestial objects, which, if compressed any further, would collapse completely into black holes. Just one teaspoonful of neutron star matter would weigh a billion tons on Earth.</p>
 <p>Although NICER is studying all types of neutron stars, the SEXTANT experiment is focused on observations of pulsars.</p>
 <p>Radiation emanating from their powerful magnetic fields is swept around much like a lighthouse.</p>
 <p>The narrow beams are seen as flashes of light when they sweep across our line of sight. With these predictable pulsations, pulsars can provide high-precision timing information similar to the atomic-clock signals supplied through the GPS system.</p>
 <p>The SEXTANT team selected four millisecond pulsar targets and directed NICER to orient itself so it could detect X-rays within their sweeping beams of light.</p>
 <p>The millisecond pulsars used by SEXTANT are so stable that their pulse arrival times can be predicted to accuracies of microseconds for years into the future.</p>
 <p>During the two-day experiment, the payload generated 78 measurements to get timing data, which the SEXTANT experiment fed into its on-board algorithms to autonomously stitch together a navigational solution that revealed the location of NICER in its orbit around Earth as a space station payload. The team compared that solution against location data gathered by NICER’s onboard GPS receiver.</p>
 <p>“For the onboard measurements to be meaningful, we needed to develop a model that predicted the arrival times using ground-based observations provided by our collaborators at radio telescopes around the world,” said Paul Ray, a SEXTANT co-investigator with the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory. “The difference between the measurement and the model prediction is what gives us our navigation information.”</p>
 <p>The goal was to demonstrate that the system could locate NICER within a 10-mile radius as the space station sped around Earth at slightly more than 17,500 mph. Within eight hours of starting the experiment on November 9, the system converged on a location within the targeted range of 10 miles and remained well below that threshold for the rest of the experiment, Mitchell said. In fact, “a good portion” of the data showed positions that were accurate to within three miles.</p>
 <p>“This was much faster than the two weeks we allotted for the experiment,” said SEXTANT System Architect Luke Winternitz, who works at Goddard. “We had indications that our system would work, but the weekend experiment finally demonstrated the system’s ability to work autonomously.”</p>
 <p>Although the ubiquitously used GPS system is accurate to within a few feet for Earth-bound users, this level of accuracy is not necessary when navigating to the far reaches of the solar system where distances between objects measure in the millions of miles. “In deep space, we hope to reach accuracies in the hundreds of feet,” Mitchell said.</p>

<p>While technology designed to replace bones has long been used in humans in the form of prosthetics and implants, muscles have proved to be more difficult to replace because of their elastic nature.</p>
 <p>But now a Japanese research team has designed a wearable robot designed to support a person’s hip joint while walking.</p>
 <p>“With a rapidly ageing society, an increasing number of elderly people require care after suffering from stroke and other-age related disabilities. Various technologies, devices, and robots are emerging to aid caretakers,” wrote Shinshu University professor Minoru Hashimoto, noting that several technologies meant to assist a person with walking are often cumbersome to the user.</p>
 <p>“[In our] current study, [we] sought to develop a lightweight, soft, wearable assist wear for supporting activities of daily life for older people with weakened muscles and those with mobility issues.”</p>

 <p>The wearable system consists of plasticised polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel, mesh electrodes, and applied voltage. The mesh electrodes sandwich the gel, and when voltage is applied, the gel flexes and contracts, like a muscle.</p>
 <p>“We thought that the electrical mechanical properties of the PVC gel could be used for robotic artificial muscles, so we started researching the PVC gel,” said Hashimoto. “The ability to add voltage to PVC gel is especially attractive for high-speed movement, and the gel moves with high speed with just a few hundred volts.”</p>
 <p>In a preliminary evaluation, a stroke patient with some paralysis on one side of his body walked with and without the wearable system.</p>
 <p>“We found that the assist wear enabled natural movement, increasing step length and decreasing muscular activity during straight-line walking,” wrote Hashimoto. The researchers also found that adjusting the charge could change the level of assistance the actuator provides.</p>

 <p>Next, the researchers plan to create a string actuator using the PVC gel, which could potentially lead to the development of fabric capable of providing more manageable external muscular support with ease.</p>
 <p>In 2016 scientists <a href="/content/articles/2016/07/muscle-sensing-tattoo-detects-emotions-and-alertness/" target="_blank">developed a patch </a>that senses the electrical activity of muscles, which could represent a breakthrough in emotion reading and therapy for strokes patients. </p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The extent to which the computer services arm of the worldwide IT industry is overshadowed by its more glamourous hardware and programming counterparts is exemplified by its portrayal by the entertainment industry. Real‑life company figureheads like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg have sustained big-budget movies with plots telling the story of their achievements. Where are the films based on their equivalents in the massive companies that employ millions and make worldwide annual revenues approaching a trillion dollars from the more mundane business of keeping the wheels of modern industry turning?</p>
 <p>Specialist support with maintaining and developing IT systems as an enterprise in itself has existed for almost as long as people have been using digital computers. Had Charles Babbage’s 19th-century mechanical calculating engines moved beyond prototype stage, it’s easy to imagine how quickly an ecosystem of engineers and technicians would have sprung up, dedicated to helping businesses plan how to adopt this new technology and then being on hand when the hardware needed fixing and upgrading.</p>
 <p>Jeffrey Yost, a science and technology historian who is associate director of the institute at the University of Minnesota that takes its name from Babbage, turns a spotlight on this significant but neglected aspect in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/making-it-work" target="_blank">‘Making IT Work: A History of the Computer Services Industry’</a> (The MIT Press, £30.95, ISBN 9780262036726), a comprehensive history that is the latest volume from the MIT Press History of Computing series.</p>
 <figure class="article-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5316/making-it-work-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&rnd=131601593770000000"> <source media="(min-width: 960px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5316/making-it-work-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131601593770000000"> <source media="(min-width 760px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5316/making-it-work-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=640&rnd=131601593770000000"> <source media="(min-width 320px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5316/making-it-work-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=320&rnd=131601593770000000"> <!-- fallback image for non supporting browsers --> <img class="img-responsive lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="/media/5316/making-it-work-cover.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131601593770000000" /> </picture> </figure>
 <p>One of the main reasons why this is among the first accounts of a sector that will be familiar to anyone who has ever had cause to ‘call IT’ to deal with a computer problem, is its disparate nature, Yost acknowledges. “It is an enigmatic industry, characterised by diversity and dynamism, that sometimes defies clear definition,” he writes.</p>
 <p>Much of the material in ‘Making IT Work’ comes from newly available archive sources, particularly at the Charles Babbage Institute, and from corporate records of firms like services giant IBM. Yost has also interviewed some of the key figures from the history of computer services and mined the seemingly ephemeral trade literature from past decades, which has since acquired massive historical value.</p>
 <p>Equally, this is an attempt to give a fair hearing to an industry that has frequently ended up as the scapegoat when large-scale IT projects go wrong, as they so often do in both public and private sectors. Services companies, Yost explains, have the unenviable task of bringing together the work of programmers and hardware developers in a way that works in the real world. “Creating software is hard and managing large-scale programming and systems integration is much harder.”</p>
 <p>Tracing the evolution of the computer services industry from the 1950s to the present, Yost provides case studies of companies including IBM, Hewlett Packard, Andersen/Accenture, EDS, Infosys and others, together with profiles of such influential leaders as John Diebold, Ross Perot and Virginia Rometty.</p>
 <p>Although the focus is largely on US firms, ‘Making IT Work’ puts their development in a global context. And with the emergence of cloud computing making geographical location less important than ever before, there’s much that industry can learn from the story of how it has reached its current position.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne and colleagues at Monash University believe the pill-sized ingestible devices, which measure hydrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen and send results to a mobile phone, will be a game-changer for the one-in-five people worldwide who will suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder in their lifetime. They could also reduce the need for invasive procedures like colonoscopies.</p>
 <p>Professor Kourosh Kalantar-zadeh, a co-inventor of the device who led the tests, believes the results <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-017-0004-x" target="_blank">reported in Nature Electronics</a> could improve understanding of how debilitating diseases like colon cancer occur. They also demonstrated that the capsule could offer a much more effective way of measuring microbiome activities in the stomach, a critical way of determining gut health, he added.</p>
 <p>"Previously, we have had to rely on faecal samples or surgery to sample and analyse microbes in the gut. But this meant measuring them when they are not a true reflection of the gut microbiota at that time. Our capsule will offer a non-invasive method to measure microbiome activity."</p>
 <figure class="article-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5314/gas-sensing-capsule.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&rnd=131601578220000000"> <source media="(min-width: 960px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5314/gas-sensing-capsule.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131601578220000000"> <source media="(min-width 760px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5314/gas-sensing-capsule.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=640&rnd=131601578220000000"> <source media="(min-width 320px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5314/gas-sensing-capsule.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=320&rnd=131601578220000000"> <!-- fallback image for non supporting browsers --> <img class="img-responsive lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="/media/5314/gas-sensing-capsule.png?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131601578220000000" /> </picture> </figure>
 <p>Each capsule’s electronic components are housed in an opaque polyethylene shell 26mm long and 9.8 mm in diameter. They include gas sensors capable of operating in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, a temperature sensor, a microcontroller, a 433MHz transmission system and a button-size silver oxide battery.</p>
 <p>Information about temperature and the concentration of the gases being monitored is continuously transmitted from the capsule to a monitor that uses a Bluetooth connection to display profiles in real time on a mobile phone.</p>
 <p>The temperature sensor and transmission circuit require a low enough current to be able to operate for nearly 30 days, which means devices can be tracked for their entire journey through the body and retrieved once excreted. Future versions might be able to run even longer by harvesting energy from the liquid of the gut. Gas sensing requires more energy, but is extended to four days by including a microcontroller that puts the electronic components inside the capsule to sleep mode when not in use.</p>
 <p>According to co-inventor Dr Kyle Berean, ingestible sensors offer a potential diagnostic tool for many disorders of the gut from food nutrient malabsorption to colon cancer. “It is good news that a less invasive procedure will now be an option for so many people in the future,” he commented.</p>
 <p>The project also uncovered previously unseen mechanisms in the human body, including a potentially new immune system. The trials found evidence that the human stomach uses an oxidiser to fight foreign bodies that stay in the gut for longer than usual, an immune response that has never been reported before. Another never before seen observation was the presence of high concentrations of oxygen in the colon under an extremely high-fibre diet, contradicting the belief that the colon is always oxygen free.</p>
 <p>Now that the capsule has successfully passed human trials, the research team has partnered with Planet Innovation to establish a new company, Atmo Biosciences, which will commercialise the technology and bring a product to market.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>From the end of March 2018, all new cars and vans will be equipped with the eCall system, which automatically calls the Europe-wide 112 number in the event of a serious accident.</p>
 <p>The system is designed to speed up emergency response times and it’s estimated that it could save up to 2,500 lives across Europe each year.</p>
 <p>Mariya Gabriel, commissioner responsible for Digital Economy and Society, said: “eCall is a tangible example of how the EU can bring real benefits of digital technology to its citizens, no matter where they are in the EU.</p>
 <p>“By combining the single EU emergency number – 112 – with the EU’s satellite navigation system and GSM technology, it saves lives by making emergency responses faster.”</p>
 <p>An eCall device works by receiving signals from GPS satellites and the EU’s <a href="/content/articles/2017/12/europe-s-gps-rival-is-nearly-complete-following-penultimate-galileo-launch/" target="_blank">nearly complete </a>Galileo system. </p>
 <p>When fitted to a vehicle, eCall will automatically contact emergency services in the event of a serious crash with vital information like the vehicle type, the location and time of the accident and the direction of travel (most important on motorways), even if the driver is unconscious or unable to make a phone call.</p>
 <p>The new guidelines for manufacturers follow intensive testing of the eCall on-board units at the the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). Manufacturers have been sending in their devices for testing and preliminary feedback.</p>
 <p>The JRC’s Tibor Navracsics said: “Any legislation is only as good as its implementation. The EU’s push to save lives by mandating eCall will work only if the on-board units are fit for purpose.</p>
 <p>“That is why the European Commission’s science service has been reaching out to industry, assessing their devices and providing feedback to manufacturers on their models and to test centres on their procedures.”</p>
 <p>Once the roll-out of eCall throughout the EU is complete, it will become the second largest market for the nascent Galileo system after the location-based services running on smartphones.</p>
 <p>Elżbieta Bieńkowska, commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, said: “Knowing the precise location of an accident is crucial for saving lives. Using Europe’s own satellite navigation system Galileo, which is operational for a year now, will enable the emergency response teams to locate the accident with much greater accuracy.</p>
 <p>“The mandatory eCall system is a puzzle piece of what our mobility will look like in the future: connected and automated driving with low- and zero-emission cars. With the roll-out of eCall in April 2018, we are taking a major step forward for adoption of Galileo in the automotive market.”</p>

<p>The pre-programmed, light-carrying mini drones, working together in a system called ‘Shooting Star’, use special location technology to stay in formation.</p>
 <p>Anil Nanduri, vice president of Intel’s drone group, said the Shooting Star programme represents a new art form and offers a new form of entertainment.</p>
 <p>During the CES tech show in Las Vegas, the technology giant deployed 250 of the craft to the famous fountain show outside the Bellagio hotel in the city.</p>
 <p>“Why a light show? There are two aspects to it – what the light show is to you is a beautiful formation and creative art in the sky,” he said.</p>
 <p>“For me, it’s the technology of controls. Flying a swarm, flying a fleet – that has never been done before and that same technology tomorrow I can apply to search and rescue, for example.”</p>
 <p>He said the same programming of the drones, which keeps them close to each other without crashing, could be used to sweep large areas during a search.</p>
 <p>The advance in technology also meant there was now an opportunity to evolve firework displays to something more modern.</p>
 <div class="responsive-media video"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXSyJNN1XgQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>
 <p>“Fireworks have been around for centuries. Now fireworks create a lot of pollution – noise,” he said.</p>
 <p>“We all enjoy fireworks, but that has been the only way you could enjoy something in the sky other than being in Norway and looking at the Northern Lights.</p>
 <p>“What you’re seeing in the Shooting Star system is the ability for you to create that story. You can create shapes, logos or animations and turn it into a story and that is a new form – you can now paint in the sky, but without the pollution. It’s reusable and it’s safe.</p>
 <p>“For us, light shows are a way of redefining night-sky entertainment. It’s more than fireworks. Because with fireworks you can’t get shapes or logos. You get a lot of colour and a vibrant mix of sound but here sound can come through music and you will see that in the show.”</p>
 <p>Intel is one of many industry giants showcasing new technology at CES, the four-day electronics fair.</p>
 <p>The event, which attracts more than 170,000 visitors, was hit with major disruption on Wednesday when a power cut triggered by condensation from heavy rain plunged large parts of the convention centre into darkness.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>UK Prime Minister Theresa May said all “avoidable” plastic waste will be eliminated in the country over the next 25 years as she unveiled her government’s long-term action plan for cleaning up the environment today.</p>
 <p>Supermarkets will be urged to introduce “plastic-free” aisles, where shoppers can pick up products free from layers of plastic wrapping.</p>
 <p>The 5p charge for plastic carrier bags will be extended to all retailers in England, closing a loophole under which smaller shops are currently excluded from this measure. Taxes or charges on other single-use items such as plastic cutlery and takeaway boxes will also be considered.</p>
 <p>Critics, including Labour’s shadow environment minister Holly Lynch, questioned why there was no mention of a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles – an idea that had previously been mooted in Whitehall.</p>
 <p>The Liberal Democrats said it “beggared belief” that a target of 2042 had been set, calling for urgent action now. Others requested greater clarity over the term <span>“avoidable plastic”, saying this was too ill-defined.  </span></p>
 <p>Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, called the plan “vague” and also criticised the government’s stance on fracking for shale gas, a form of fossil fuel.</p>
 <p>In today<span>’</span>s speech the Prime Minister said the problem of plastic waste, much of which ends up in the seas, was “one of the great environmental scourges of our time”.</p>
 <p>She promised that the UK would show global leadership on the issue, taking action at every stage of the production and consumption of plastic.</p>
 <p>“We look back in horror at some of the damage done to our environment in the past and wonder how anyone could have thought that, for example, dumping toxic chemicals, untreated, into rivers was ever the right thing to do.</p>
 <p>“In years to come, I think people will be shocked at how today we allow so much plastic to be produced needlessly.</p>
 <p>“In the UK alone, the amount of single-use plastic wasted every year would fill 1,000 Royal Albert Halls.”</p>
 <p>The government has also announced a new fund for research into “plastics innovation” designed to reduce the harmful effects of the materials. Money is expected to be allocated to projects in the developing world to cut down on the amount of litter finding its way into rivers there.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, a scheme to help more children engage with the environment will include £10m for school visits and a programme to create school grounds which allow youngsters to learn more about the natural world.</p>

<p>A leading international relations think tank today warned nuclear-armed countries could be duped into firing atomic missiles by <span>cyber attackers – even if their computer systems were effectively isolated from the internet.</span></p>

use suggested military chiefs had allowed themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security about the extent to which their weapons systems could be shielded from malware by being cut off from the web.</p>
 <p>Their report, published today, assesses the likelihood of a cyberstrike on a nuclear weapons system as being “relatively high”. They say “urgent attention” must be paid to identifying potential vulnerabilities in Britain’s Trident weapons infrastructure as well as analogous systems underpinning the arsenals of allies such as France and America.</p>
 <p>Hostile countries like North Korea should also be assessed for weaknesses and special cyber hotlines between potential belligerents – similar to communication channels that existed during the Cold War – should be established.</p>
 <p>The duo of researchers cited the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear centrifuges – via IT equipment that had been “air-gapped” or cordoned off from the web – as an example of what was possible.</p>
 <p>They said an insider attack could be launched by inserting a simple thumb drive into an otherwise quarantined computer, as happened in the Stuxnet case.</p>
 <p>Organisational processes such as subcontracting and lengthy procurement regimes could heighten the risk of insider malfeasance and cyber weakness, they warned, adding: “In this equation, people are both the strongest and the weakest link, particularly with the high volume of personnel at defence companies.”</p>
 <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which is sometimes seen as a panacea in eliminating human error, could in fact exacerbate problems because it was predicated on the assumption that future events could be predicted based on data about past experiences.</p>
 <p>Hostile state actors could exploit that by crafting an attack specifically designed to trick AI-enabled systems into thinking it was harmless.</p>
 <p>Better verification of information through cooperation between allied nations and “diversified intelligence sources” could guard against the risk of the UK launching a Trident missile by mistake after being duped by terrorists or a hostile state into thinking a nuclear attack on Britain itself was imminent.</p>
 <p>They said Russia had been working on a new spoofing device that could imitate jets, rockets or a missile attack and thereby fool defence systems.</p>
 <p>This type of cyber spoofing was judged to be a particular threat, but other types of trickery involving viruses designed to infect and disable specific parts of computer systems were also highlighted in the report.</p>
 <p>The threat to nuclear weapons from cyber attacks is nothing new. The US is reported to have successfully infiltrated parts of North Korea’s missile systems and caused test failures in the past. Additionally, German-owned Patriot missiles in Turkey were reported to have been hacked in 2015.</p>
 <p>Unal and Lewis said hackers and organised crime groups had joined forces in Moldova and Georgia to collaborate in the illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear materials.</p>
 <p>They added that individuals affiliated with so-called Islamic State had monitored the movements of a nuclear scientist in Belgium, for reasons as yet unknown.</p>
 <p>According to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report from 2014, nine countries have nuclear forces: the United States, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The radio waves are so bright that they’re supposedly visible across much of the nearby universe and are nearly 100 per cent linearly polarised, an indication that the source of the bursts is embedded in strong magnetic fields like those around a massive black hole.</p>
 <p>Scientists at UC Berkley’s Breakthrough Listen project have been speculating about the nature of the source of the waves, which has been called FRB 121102.</p>
 <p>The project began last year and is tasked with searching for intelligent, extra-terrestrial communications in the Universe. It has already raked in $100m in funding and used thousands of hours of dedicated telescope time on state-of-the-art facilities.</p>
 <p>More than 200 high-energy bursts have been observed coming from the source, which is located in a dwarf galaxy about 3 billion light years from Earth.</p>
 <p>The near-100-per-cent polarisation of the radio bursts is unusual, and has only been seen in radio emissions from the extreme magnetic environments around massive black holes, such as those at the centres of galaxies.</p>
 <p>The team has suggested that the fast radio bursts (FRBs) may come from a highly magnetised rotating neutron star - a magnetar - in the vicinity of a massive black hole that is still growing as gas and dust fall into it.</p>
 <p>The short bursts, which range from 30 microseconds to 9 milliseconds in duration, indicate that the source could be as small as 10 kilometres across - the typical size of a neutron star.</p>
 <p>Other possible sources are a magnetar interacting with the nebula of material shed when the original star exploded to produce the magnetar, or interactions with the highly magnetised wind from a rotating neutron star, or a pulsar.</p>
 <p>“At this point, we don’t really know the mechanism. There are many questions, such as, how can a rotating neutron star produce the high amount of energy typical of an FRB?” said UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow Vishal Gajjar of Breakthrough Listen and the Berkeley SETI Research Center.</p>
 <p>“This result is an excellent demonstration of the capabilities of the Breakthrough Listen instrumentation and the synergies between SETI and other types of astronomy,” said Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and of the Breakthrough Listen programme. “We look forward to working with the international scientific community to learn more about these enigmatic and dynamic sources.”</p>
 <p>Another possibility, though remote, is that the FRB is a high-powered signal from an advanced civilisation. “We cannot rule out completely the ET hypothesis for the FRBs in general,” Gajjar said.</p>
 <p>Breakthrough Listen has to date recorded data from a dozen FRBs, including FRB 121102, and plans eventually to sample all 30-some known sources of fast radio bursts.</p>
 <p>“We want a complete sample so that we can conduct our standard SETI analysis in search of modulation patterns or narrow-band signals – any kind of information-bearing signal emitted from their direction that we don’t expect from nature,” he said.</p>
 <p>Breakthrough Listen allotted tens of hours of observational time on the Green Bank Telescope to recording radio emissions from FRB 121102, and on 26 August 2017 detected 15 bursts over a relatively short period of five hours.</p>
 <p>The team plans a few more observations of FRB 121102 before moving on to other FRB sources. Gajjar said that they want to observe at higher frequencies - up to 12GHz, versus the present Green Bank observations in the 4-8GHz range - to see if the energy drops off at higher frequencies. This could help narrow the range of possible sources, he said.</p>
 <p>A team of researchers <a href="/content/articles/2018/01/mysterious-dimming-star-alien-megastructure-theory-debunked/" target="_blank">recently debunked a theory </a>that aliens could be responsible for the unusual dimming and brightening of a distant star, although they still don’t understand its odd behaviour. </p>

<title>49-qubit quantum computer presented by Intel</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>While classical computers store information in binary code – as a series of 0s and 1s – quantum computers harness phenomena that arise at the quantum scale, allowing for particles to exist in multiple states (0 and 1) at once. This allows data to be stored far more efficiently than in classical computers, vastly increasing processing speeds.</p>
 <p>Problems which take hours of processing time on supercomputers – such as biological or astronomical simulations – could be solved in an instant using a quantum computer.</p>
 <p>Intel is among a number of companies, including IBM, Google and Microsoft, competing to build practical quantum computers that could eventually begin replacing some classical computers.</p>
 <p>The race to build quantum computers <a href="/content/articles/2016/11/the-trouble-with-quantum-computing/">is full of challenges</a>, largely due to maintaining the stability of the fragile quantum system. For operations to be completed, the system must be ‘coherent’: there must be a definite phase relation between the different quantum states. When the system is not perfectly isolated from its surroundings, interactions with its environment cause coherence to be lost; this is <span>‘decoherence</span><span>’</span>.</p>
 <p>Now, in a keynote presentation at CES, Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, announced that the company had created a 49-bit quantum computing chip. This chip has been named ‘Tangle Lake’.</p>
 <p>“Quantum computing represents a completely different approach to computing. This technology will be able to solve problems that are insurmountable today,” said Krzanich. “Just as we ushered in the era of our classical personal computing, we’re pushing the boundaries of the quantum computing revolution.”</p>
 <p>According to Krzanich, the chip has been shipped for testing, and he is “optimistic” about the possibilities for the technology.</p>
 <p>A group of US researchers presented a quantum simulator with 51 qubits in 2017, although this simulator is distinct from a computer, as it can solve just one equation. Similarly, the 2000-qubit system developed by D-Wave is not a true computer. The real competition for Intel in the quantum computer race continues to be from IBM, which announced in November 2017 that it had created a 50-qubit processor, and Google, which has draughted blueprints for a 49-qubit system.</p>
 <p>At the keynote speech, Krzanich also spoke about Intel’s development of an energy-efficient neuromorphic test chip nicknamed ‘Loihi’. This self-learning chip mimics human neurons to recognise images and complete other tasks.</p>

 <p>Intel has been under fire over the past week following the revelation of two major chip  security flaws – named Meltdown and Spectre – affecting most Intel chips manufactured since 1995. Intel chips are used in 90 per cent of laptops and 80 per cent of desktop computers.</p>
 <p>Despite anger over the security flaw and the months-long delay in reporting it – which Intel has stated was due to the company wanting to find a fix first – Krzanich went ahead with his featured CES appearance, stating 90 per cent of products from the past five years would be patched within a week.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The photography company will collaborate with Wenn Media Group to create KodakCoin, its own cryptocurrency. The initial coin offering will open on 31 January.</p>
 <p>KodakCoin is just one aspect of a blockchain-based program named KodakONE to protect the rights of photographs and help them collect their royalties. Through this program, photographers may license their work using KodakCoin.</p>
 <p>“Utilising blockchain technology, the KodakONE platform will create an encrypted digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers to register both new and archive work that they can then license within the platform,” the company said in a statement.</p>
 <p>The KodakONE project uses software to search for photographs online which have been used without authorisation. The company then organises for the photographer to be paid for rights to their image in KodakCoin.</p>
 <p>“For many in the tech industry, “blockchain” and “cryptocurrency” are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,” said Jeff Clarke, Kodak CEO.</p>
 <p>“Kodak has always sought to democractise photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.”</p>
 <p>At CES 2018, Kodak also announced that it plans to begin mining Bitcoin – the first decentralised virtual currency – at its New York headquarters through a scheme called ‘Kodah KashMiner’.</p>
 <p>Cryptocurrencies rely on solving cryptographic problems to validate transactions to add to their blockchains – public ledgers of transaction. Cryptocurrency mining is the use of huge amounts of computational power to solve these problems, in return for a small amount of new currency.</p>
 <p>At the show, Kodak presented “mining rig” boxes intended for this energy-intensive activity which include fans to keep them cool as they run around the clock.  It will also rent out these mining rigs to customers keen to try it for themselves, with profits being shared between customer and Kodak. According to Kodak, the mining rigs can be powered considerably more cheaply than a rig at home.</p>
 <p>Formerly dominant in the world of photography, Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012; its delay in embracing digital photography is credited with this. Since then, it has struggled back from collapse, selling many of its patents for approximately half a billion dollars to companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft Facebook and Amazon.</p>
 <p>Following Kodak’s announcements at CES 2018, its shares briefly exploded in value by approximately 120 per cent, although some commentators expressed confusion over why the move into the cryptocurrency sector is relevant for the photography company, as well as expressing scepticism about the increasing number of companies and governments creating their own currencies.</p>

<title>Ineos fights Scottish Government fracking ‘ban’</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>The petrochemical giant said it would seek a judicial review of the “unlawful” ban, arguing there were “very serious errors” in the decision-making process.</p>
 <p>But the Scottish government has argued that it took a “careful and considered approach” while coming to the decision, with “detailed assessment of evidence”.</p>
 <p>It placed a moratorium on the controversial gas extraction technique in 2015, and in October last year energy minister Paul Wheelhouse announced that planning regulations would be used to “effectively ban” it by extending the moratorium “indefinitely”.</p>
 <p>“The Scottish Government’s position was endorsed by the Scottish Parliament in October, subject to completion of a strategic environmental assessment, and follows detailed assessment of the evidence and consultation with the public,” he said in response to Ineos’s latest claims.</p>
 <p>Last year, 99 per cent of respondents to a public consultation backed the ban and government-commissioned research “does not provide a strong enough basis from which to address these communities’ concerns”.</p>
 <p>The Scottish Labour and Green parties called for fracking to be formally banned through legislation, but Wheelhouse insisted that the indefinite moratorium was “robust” enough that this was not necessary.</p>
 <p>Tom Pickering, operations director at Ineos Shale, said: “The decision in October was a major blow to Scottish science and its engineering industry, as well as being financially costly to Ineos, other businesses and, indeed, the nation as a whole.</p>
 <p>“We have serious concerns about the legitimacy of the ban and have therefore applied to the court to ask that it review the competency of the decision to introduce it.”</p>
 <p>Ineos Shale has lodged a petition for judicial review alongside co-venture partner Reach at the Court of Session, Scotland’s highest civil court, arguing there was a “failure to adhere to proper statutory process and a misuse of ministerial power”.</p>
 <p>The company said the ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction would result in Scotland missing out on economic benefits, including about 3,100 Scottish jobs and £1bn for local communities.</p>
 <p>In 2016, before the ban took place, Ineos chief Jim Ratcliffe said that <a href="/content/articles/2016/09/fracking-is-safe-claims-ineos-boss-as-us-shale-gas-arrives/" target="_blank">fracking could revive communities</a> paralysed by manufacturing collapse. </p>
 <p>Ineos Shale said millions that had been invested in acquiring licences and obtaining planning permission for drilling sites had been “rendered worthless” by the ban.</p>
 <p>“This despite the panel of scientific experts appointed by the Scottish Government concluding that shale development is capable of being managed safely,” the company said.</p>
 <p>Green MSP Mark Ruskell said: “This is a predictable and desperate attempt by an industry sinking under public protest in England to try and salvage the last drop of commercial benefit in Scotland.</p>
 <p>“Scotland doesn’t want or need fracking and Ineos should accept they lost the democratic debate in the Scottish Parliament, the evidence was there to ban fracking and that is what Holyrood has done.”</p>
 <p>Friends of the Earth Scotland also said the move “reeks of desperation” and it was confident the courts would find against Ineos.</p>
 <p>But Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: “The SNP’s decision to ban fracking is rooted in dogma, and ignores the economic benefits it could bring to Scotland.</p>
 <p>“Further exploration of shale extraction could also reduce the need for gas imports, and even help relieve fuel poverty.</p>
 <p>“The Scottish Government’s own advisers know this, yet still ministers are sticking to this needless and potentially damaging ban.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Forty-one-year-old Norishige Kanai, who went to space last month for a nearly six-month mission, posted on Twitter on Monday that he had “a big announcement.”</p>
 <p>“My height’s been measured here in space and somehow, somehow, I’ve grown 9 cm! In only three weeks I’ve really shot up, something I haven’t seen since high school,” he tweeted.</p>
 <p>“This makes me a little worried that I might not be able to fit in the Soyuz seats for our return.”</p>
 <p>But a little over a day later - and in the wake of a flurry of news stories - he apologised, saying that he’d measured himself after his captain raised questions about the apparent growth and he had stretched only 2 cm from his Earth-bound height.</p>
 <p>“This mis-measurement appears to have become a big deal, so I must apologise for this terrible fake news,” he later tweeted, without explaining how the original miscalculation had occurred.</p>
 <p>“It appears I can fit on the Soyuz, so I’m relieved.”</p>
 <p>Most astronauts ‘grow’ during protracted space missions because their spines extend in the absence of gravity, but the gains are usually limited to a couple of centimetres maximum and disappear once they are back on the ground.</p>
 <p>Speaking to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42618786" target="_blank">BBC News</a>, Libby Jackson of the UK Space Agency said: “Nine centimetres is a lot, but it is possible, knowing that every human body is different,”</p>
 <p>“You do get taller in space as your spine drifts apart, usually by about two to five centimetres.</p>
 <p>“There’s a range of growth for different people, and everybody responds differently.”</p>
 <p>Last week Nasa announced that it had <a href="/content/articles/2018/01/space-debris-sensor-attached-to-iss-to-monitor-debris/" target="_blank">attached a space debris sensor </a>(SDS) to the outside of the ISS to allow researchers to track space debris impacts in real-time. </p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Planned (or ‘built-in’) obsolescence is the practice of designing products with limited useful lifespans, so that they become faulty - or unfashionable - after a chosen amount of time. Although this is a well-established practice for stimulating continued consumption in electronics, fashion and other sectors, it is strongly criticised for contributing to waste and pollution.</p>
 <p>In France, however, it is against the law for a company to deliberately shorten the lifespan of a product in order to encourage consumers to continue buying; a 2015 law requires that companies declare the lifespan of their products and disclose how long spare parts will continue to be manufactured.</p>
 <p>From 2016, it became a legal requirement in France for manufacturers to repair or replace faulty products within two years of purchase.</p>
 <p>Apple’s iPhones are notoriously difficult and expensive to repair, with ‘tamper-resistant screws’ that cannot be removed with standard tools. Due to the loyalty of Apple users to the brand, their next model is likely to be another iPhone. Given this, planned obsolescence would be a safe and lucrative policy for the company.</p>
 <p>In December 2017, Apple confirmed widespread consumer suspicions that <a href="/content/articles/2017/12/apple-admits-it-deliberately-slows-down-older-iphones/">older iPhones are deliberately slowed</a> down via software updates, although the company stated that this was due to a need to protect their processors and hence extend the lifetime of the devices as their batteries degrade over time.</p>
 <p>The issue can be solved by replacing the iPhone’s battery, a service which cost £79 at an Apple Store. Following anger over Apple’s admission, the price has been cut to £25.</p>
 <p>“We have never – and would never – do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-battery-and-performance/">the statement</a> said. “our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible as an important part of that.”</p>
 <p>Following Apple’s statement, a pressure group, Stop Planned Obsolescence, filed a complaint against the company. According to the group, Apple could face a fine of five per cent its annual turnover, or a custodial sentence. Apple will be investigated by the French government’s consumer protection agency.</p>
 <p>According to reports, Apple is facing at least 26 lawsuits in the US regarding its slowdown of older iPhones. Claimants argue that Apple failed to disclose the changes made with its software updates.</p>
 <p>Already, the US and Israel have investigated Apple for its practices, although these countries do not have laws in force criminalising built-in obsolescence. While France was the first country to introduce a law criminalising the practice, the European Union is also in the process of addressing the issue.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Microbeads are tiny pieces of plastic less than a millimetre in size. They are used frequently in cosmetic products such as exfoliators, as well as in toothpaste, shower gels and other products. A single shower can wash 100,000 microbeads down the drain.</p>
 <p>Thousands of tonnes of microbeads seep into rivers and oceans, polluting the water and harming marine creatures, which often mistake the beads for food and ingest them. While microbeads are just one small part of the vast issue of plastic pollution of the oceans, they are widely considered an easily preventable aspect of the problem.</p>
 <p>“Microbeads in cosmetics are an avoidable part of the problem, which is why we called for a ban,” said Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, in a statement.</p>
 <p>“This is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done. Since we called for a ban, my committee has also recommended a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles, a latte levy for plastic-lined coffee cups and reforms to make producers responsible for their packaging. We look forward to hearing the government’s response.”</p>
 <p>The government first pledged to ban microbeads in September 2016. This followed the introduction of the 2015 Microbead-Free Waters Act in the US, which phased out the use of microbeads in cosmetics by July 2017.</p>
 <p>Today, Dr Thérèse Coffey, an environment minister, announced that the ban would be coming into force. The ban – which has been praised for its toughness – will mean that microbeads can no longer be used in the manufacture of cosmetics and personal care products.</p>
 <div class="social-embed-outer clearfix"> <div class="social-embed-inner"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today <a href="https://twitter.com/theresecoffey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@theresecoffey</a> has announced that a ban on the manufacture of products containing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/microbeads?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#microbeads</a> comes into force. It’s a landmark step in the introduction of one of the world’s toughest bans on these harmful pieces of plastic <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreenBrexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GreenBrexit</a> <a href="https://t.co/v5z5kLEcBP">https://t.co/v5z5kLEcBP</a> <a href="https://t.co/0upYi5AWFo">pic.twitter.com/0upYi5AWFo</a></p>&mdash; Defra UK (@DefraGovUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefraGovUK/status/950623183236837377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote>
 <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> </div>
 <p>“The world’s seas and oceans are some of our most valuable natural assets and I am determined we act now to tackle the plastic that devastates our precious marine life,” said Coffey.</p>
 <p>“Microbeads are entirely unnecessary when there are so many natural alternatives available, and I am delighted that from today cosmetics manufacturers will no longer be able to add this harmful plastic to their rinse-off products.”</p>
 <p>It will be followed by a ban on sales of these products later in the year, a government statement confirmed.</p>
 <p>Due to a growing backlash against the use of microbeads in cosmetics products, many companies had already begun phasing out microbeads in their products, replacing them with more natural ingredients with similar exfoliating properties, such as sugar crystals, crushed kernels or ground pumice.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Surveillance camera commissioner Tony Porter flagged up the possible risk of intrusion on the public by “individual and state actors”.</p>
 <p>He pointed to a major cyber incident in Washington DC in January 2017, in which more than 100 cameras were infected with ransomware.</p>
 <p>The UK currently holds the record for the largest number of CCTV cameras per person. Although it only contains 1 per cent of world's population, its citizens are watched by 20 per cent of the world’s CCTV cameras. Research in 2013 estimated that there are up to six million cameras in the UK, and the network is expected to expand even further.</p>
 <p>“The risk potential for intrusion on citizens has significantly increased both by lawful operators of surveillance camera systems and those individual or state actors who seek to hack into systems,” Porter said. “Cyber security has moved to the top of the security agenda.”</p>
 <figure class="article-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5304/dreamstime_xxl_45578817.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&rnd=131599765360000000"> <source media="(min-width: 960px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5304/dreamstime_xxl_45578817.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131599765360000000"> <source media="(min-width 760px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5304/dreamstime_xxl_45578817.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=640&rnd=131599765360000000"> <source media="(min-width 320px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5304/dreamstime_xxl_45578817.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=320&rnd=131599765360000000"> <!-- fallback image for non supporting browsers --> <img class="img-responsive lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="/media/5304/dreamstime_xxl_45578817.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131599765360000000" /> </picture> </figure>
 <p>Publishing his annual report for 2016/17, Porter said surveillance cameras are not always recognised as potential hacking targets.</p>
 <p>“As we move from analogue to digital surveillance, most cameras are plugged into corporate IT networks. If your camera is not suitably protected you are potentially opening up a back door for organisations that choose to hack."</p>
 <p>“What we are saying is that cameras are potentially your vulnerable point. You must ensure that you apply the same level of IT security to your cameras as you do to your mainframe.</p>
 <p>“There is a whole host of areas where data could be accessed through insecure surveillance networks," he continued. “I am concerned at the incrementally intrusive development of surveillance cameras in the everyday lives of citizens.”</p>
 <p>The assessment also called for the Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system to be placed on a statutory footing.</p>
 <p>ANPR is one of the largest non-military databases in the UK, with around 9,000 cameras nationally that capture between 25 million and 40 million pieces of data per day, while up to 20 billion “read” records are held.</p>
 <p>Porter described this activity as “formidable”, saying: “The nature of its capabilities to intrude on privacy by building patterns of travel and the provision of imagery should not be underestimated.</p>
 <p>“I firmly believe that this system needs legislative oversight and that the Government should place this system on a statutory footing.”</p>
 <p>The watchdog noted that arguments have been advanced that the number of manufacturers of number plates should be limited, but suggested that a system of stricter controls may be needed, similar to the production of driving licences and passports.</p>
 <p>A Home Office spokesman said: “Automatic number plate recognition gives police vital evidence to protect the public. There are strict rules in place for how the ANPR database can be used and who can access it."</p>
 <p>“The Surveillance Camera Code of Practice sets out clear rules to be followed to guard against unauthorised access and use of surveillance cameras.”</p>

<p>The technology uses liquid-based sensors which contain an emulsion made from graphene, water and oil, which conducts electricity.</p>
 <p>Comprised of carbon atoms, as a material graphene is strong, flexible and conductive, when a channel or tube holding the liquid is stretched, even by a small amount, the conductivity of the liquid changes.</p>
 <p>This means that the respiration rates and pulses of those wearing the device can be tracked.</p>
 <p>Professor Alan Dalton of the University of Sussex said: “Using the conducting liquid emulsions we have developed, we will produce cheap, wearable sensors based on graphene.</p>
 <p>“The devices will be comfortable, non-invasive and can provide intuitive diagnostics of breathing and heart rate.</p>
 <p>“We will eventually have a suit that the baby can wear which will read out all vital information wirelessly.</p>
 <p>“We hope to see this made available within two to four years.”</p>
 <p>They were inspired to create the health monitor after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation called for new affordable, wearable health technologies for babies in situations where resources are scarce.</p>
 <p>Currently, to monitor the pulses of babies clunky sensors need to be attached to their tiny hands or feet, and often fall off.</p>
 <p>Due to the liquid technology being so sensitive, it picks up very small signals when attached to the body, the University of Sussex said.</p>
 <p>This means monitoring could be done wirelessly and non-invasively with a fitness tracker like band, or even embedded within the fabric of a sensor vest for a baby to wear.</p>
 <p>Prof Dalton said the sensor they have created in the lab has the potential to “drastically improve” early detection of life-threatening symptoms including sleep apnea or cardiac arrhythmia, where constant monitoring with conventional equipment is challenging outside the hospital.</p>

 <p>He suggested the technology could one day even be expanded into fitness wear, and revealed he came up with the idea for the graphene emulsion as he was making a salad dressing with his daughter.</p>
 <p>“Graphene is very affordable as it can be produced using naturally-occurring graphite, so this could be rolled out on a big scale,” he added.</p>
 <p>“This is good news for health services because the new technology will not be expensive to make and buy. It also means it should be affordable to individuals.”</p>
 <p>Dr Matthew Large, lead researcher on the project, said the inclusion of graphene in the fluid stops the mixture of liquids separating over time.</p>
 <p>“The sensitivity of this new kind of strain sensor is actually much higher than a lot of existing technologies, and it is the most sensitive liquid-based device ever reported by quite a significant margin,” he added.</p>
 <p>The team members have created prototype of their technological breakthrough and they are talking to sponsors fund further research so it can be brought to market.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Net neutrality is the concept that all web traffic is treated the same, regardless of the source, application or content. It is often described by its supporters as the “first amendment of the internet”.</p>
 <p>Legislation introduced by the Obama administration came into force in 2015 to enshrine net neutrality into law, classifying internet service providers as “common carriers” and hence forbidding ISPs to prioritise, deprioritise or block content.</p>
 <p>Since his appointment as FCC Chairman by President Donald Trump in January 2017, Ajit Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon Communications, has been working to repeal this legislation. Pai argues that the regulations stifle innovation. Federal government should not be responsible for regulating the internet, he said.</p>
 <p>The process of repealing the Obama-era regulations has been controversial, largely due to reports of millions of fraudulent comments submitted during the public consultation on the policy. The FCC has not taken action to investigate these reports and proceeded with <a href="/content/articles/2017/12/fcc-votes-to-roll-back-obama-era-net-neutrality-regulations-in-us/">a 3-2 vote to repeal the regulations</a> in December 2017.</p>
 <p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman – who is spearheading an investigation into identity theft during the consultation – is among the most high-profile figures to denounce the FCC’s vote to repeal the regulations. The vote could be “illegal”, Schneiderman said.</p>
 <p>Since the FCC’s vote, representatives at the state level have been taking action to continue to protect net neutrality even after federal protections are rolled back.</p>
 <p>Adam Morfeld, a Nebraska State Senator, has introduced the Internet Neutrality Act, which is intended to restore net neutrality regulations within the state. According to the bill, ISPs will be forbidden from slowing down or prioritising traffic.</p>
 <p>“For me, this is an economic development and consumer protection bill,” Morfeld <a href="http://journalstar.com/legislature/internet-drives-the-economy-now-lincoln-senator-seeks-to-re/article_8ca09b18-9f0d-5a18-8297-90fbb75ad7da.html">told a local newspaper</a>. “The internet drives the economy now, and it’s critical people have open and fair access to the internet.”</p>
 <p>With a tech sector emerging in Nebraska, Morfeld said, it is vital to protect internet speeds and access across the state.</p>
 <p>Last week, Californian legislators introduced a bill which proposes to reclassify ISPs as public utilities, block companies that do not practice net neutrality from using telecommunications poles or acquiring government contracts.</p>
 <p>In a statement, Scott Wiener, the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, said: “We won’t let the Trump-led FCC dismantle our right to a free and open internet. We won’t let them create a system where internet providers can favour web sites and services based on who pays more money.”</p>
 <p>Morfeld and Wiener are following actions by other state representatives, including those for Massachusetts and Washington, in proposing similar local level regulations to continue to uphold net neutrality despite the FCC ruling.</p>
 <p>However, the final text for the “Restoring Internet Freedom” order, published by the FCC last week includes details which could block attempts by states to continue protecting net neutrality.</p>
 <p>“Allowing state or local regulation of broadband access service could impair the provision of such service by requiring each ISP to comply with a patchwork of separate and potentially conflicting requirements across all of the different jurisdictions in which it operates,” the ruling says.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Scientists at the University of Dundee have developed the process, which involves starving the bacteria of oxygen and flooding it with CO2 instead at a high atmospheric pressure.</p>
 <p>Cutting CO2 emissions to slow down and even reverse global warming has proved to be a considerable technological challenge.</p>
 <p>The UK government has funded carbon capture trials that take CO2 produced by power stations and store it underground. However, these efforts were ultimately deemed <a href="/content/articles/2017/01/168m-wasted-on-failed-carbon-capture-and-storage-competitions/" target="_blank">not successful enough </a>to be worth continued funding. </p>
 <p>Professor Frank Sargent, who worked on the project, said: “Reducing carbon dioxide emissions will require a basket of different solutions, and nature offers some exciting options. Microscopic, single-celled bacteria are used to living in extreme environments and often perform chemical reactions that plants and animals cannot do.</p>
 <p>“For example, the E. coli bacterium can grow in the complete absence of oxygen. When it does this it makes a special metal-containing enzyme, called ‘FHL’, which can interconvert gaseous carbon dioxide with liquid formic acid. This could provide an opportunity to capture carbon dioxide into a manageable product that is easily stored, controlled or even used to make other things. The trouble is, the normal conversion process is slow and sometimes unreliable.</p>
 <p>“What we have done is develop a process that enables the E. coli bacterium to operate as a very efficient biological carbon capture device. When the bacteria containing the FHL enzyme are placed under pressurised carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas mixtures – up to 10 atmospheres of pressure – then 100 per cent conversion of the carbon dioxide to formic acid is observed. The reaction happens quickly, over a few hours, and at ambient temperatures.</p>
 <p>“This could be an important breakthrough in biotechnology. It should be possible to optimise the system still further and finally develop a ‘microbial cell factory’ that could be used to mop up carbon dioxide from many different types of industry. Not all bacteria are bad. Some might even save the planet.”</p>
 <p>Not only capturing carbon dioxide but storing or recycling it is a major issue. There are millions of tonnes of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere every year.</p>
 <p>For the UK alone, the net emission of CO2 in 2015 was 404 million tonnes. There is a significant question of where can we put it all even if we capture it, with current suggestions including pumping it underground in to empty oil and gas fields.</p>
 <p>“The E. coli solution we have found isn’t only attractive as a carbon capture technology; it converts it into a liquid that is stable and comparatively easily stored,” said Professor Sargent.</p>
 <p>“Formic acid also has industrial uses, from a preservative and antibacterial agent in livestock feed, a coagulant in the production of rubber, and, in salt form, a de-icer for airport runways. It could also be potentially recycled into biological processes that produce CO2, forming a virtuous loop.”</p>
 <p>Last week US researchers <a href="/content/articles/2018/01/new-fossil-fuel-process-scrubs-co2-from-the-atmosphere/" target="_blank">announced they had developed </a>a chemical process for producing useful products, including electricity, from fossil fuels such as shale gas, coal and biomass without emitting CO2. </p>

 <p>Due to the high speeds that space debris reaches when caught in Earth’s orbit, even tiny particles can prove to be extremely damaging. In 2016 a significant crack appeared (pictured) in a window on the International Space Station (ISS) from what was thought to be a speck of paint travelling at extreme speeds.</p>
 <figure class="article-image"> <picture> <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5294/impact_chip.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&rnd=131598911000000000"> <source media="(min-width: 960px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5294/impact_chip.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131598911000000000"> <source media="(min-width 760px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5294/impact_chip.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=640&rnd=131598911000000000"> <source media="(min-width 320px)" data-srcset="https://dev-eandt.theiet.org/media/5294/impact_chip.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=320&rnd=131598911000000000"> <!-- fallback image for non supporting browsers --> <img class="img-responsive lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src="/media/5294/impact_chip.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=800&rnd=131598911000000000" /> </picture> </figure>
 <p>A 7mm-diameter circular chip was created from a particle that was thought to be just a few thousandths of a millimetre across.</p>
 <p>Scientists fear that if the space debris continues to worsen, humans may have to abandon any thoughts of space travel or satellite launches as it will be too dangerous.</p>
 <p>JAXA currently uses a radar system deployed in Okayama Prefecture to monitor space debris that travels over Japan in low Earth orbit at altitudes from several hundred to 2,000 kilometres. However, the current system only covers debris that is 1.6 metres across or larger. It cannot track particles of about 10 centimetres, which comprise the majority of space debris.</p>
 <p>The new radar will be roughly 200 times more sensitive that the current one.</p>
 <p>Just last week Nasa <a href="/content/articles/2018/01/space-debris-sensor-attached-to-iss-to-monitor-debris/" target="_blank">attached a space debris sensor </a>to the outside of the ISS to allow researchers to track space debris impacts in real time.</p>
 <p>There are currently more than 1,000 working satellites in orbit around Earth which are relied on for long-distance communications, internet services, navigation and other services.</p>

<p>This push is unusual, coming from major Wall Street presences, rather than smaller groups of activists. Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (one of the largest pension plans in the US) collectively control $2bn in Apple shares.</p>
 <p>In a letter sent to the company this weekend, they argued that Apple must respond to what is considered by many to be the public health issue of technology addiction.</p>
 <p>“Apple can play a defining role in signalling to the industry that paying special attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good business and the right thing to do,” the letter said.</p>
 <p>“There is a developing consensus around the world including Silicon Valley that the potential long-term consequences of new technologies need to be factored in at the outset, and no company can outsource that responsibility.”</p>
 <p>The shareholders have called on Apple to conduct research into the impact of excessive technology use on the mental health of its users, establish an expert panel to tackle the issue, as well as to take proactive steps to develop software which could help parents control their children’s phone use.</p>
 <p>Apple does not offer public guidance to parents on how to manage their children’s smartphone use, although it and many other tech companies provide some parental controls, such as adult content filters.</p>
 <p>It is estimated that <a href="http://www.tnsglobal.com/press-release/millennials-spend-one-day-a-week-on-their-phones">young people spend nearly a day a week on their phones</a>. The impact of such heavy and persistent technology use on developing brains is not well understood. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, reportedly raised their children with a low-tech lifestyle, limiting use of gadgets due to concern about the impact of excessive technology use.</p>
 <p>Concern surrounding unhealthy use of <a href="/content/articles/2017/11/facebook-was-designed-to-exploit-human-vulnerability-says-former-facebook-president/">social media</a>, <a href="/content/articles/2018/01/should-gaming-addiction-be-diagnosed-as-a-medical-condition/">video games</a> and gadgets is just one aspect of a growing scepticism about the social impact of Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook, Apple and Google. Another major issue facing these companies is the real-life impact of violent, abusive or manipulative content posted by users on internet platforms.</p>
 <p>There is some concern among investors that shares in tech giants such as Apple could suffer in the future if they fail to take on greater social responsibility for their products and services.</p>
 <p>“Socially responsible investing” aims to promote social and environmental responsibility by corporations in their activities. For instance, Jana is planning to raise a multi-billion dollar fund to lobby major companies to take corporate responsibility.</p>
 <p>Apple is on track to become the first company with a market value of $1 trillion; it is currently worth nearly $900 billion. Given the sheer size of the company, these two shareholders have limited clout, although major figures in Apple, including CEO Tim Cook, have paid lip service to corporate responsibility. In an interview with the <em>New York Times</em> in August 2017, Cook said that the company has a “moral responsibility” to help the US economy.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Riding around the conference room stage on a Segway, Lee ran down the details of all the new Monster products with impressive energy, exhorting the room to enthusiastically applaud every announcement like it was a technological revelation, even if it was simply a new pair of wireless earbuds.</p>
 <p>George Zhaq, CEO of Honor phones, joined Lee onstage to talk about Monster's new partnership with Honor which will see Monster provide custom audio products for the lifestyle mobile phone brand. This was stressed as a genuine collaboration; not just Monster repackaging and rebadging existing technology for Honor. The Honor 9 Music Set was the first product released, to be followed by the "Honor Purity powered by Monster". Like Monster, Honor targets a young, fashionable crowd.      </p>
 <p>Another Monster business partnership announced is with Tile, the company behind the tiny Bluetooth object-tracking device. Monster's ClarityHDX headphones will be the world's first headphones with Tile built in to the product, so in theory you might never lose them.</p>
 <p>Ravi Adusumilli, VP of business development at Tile, explained how Tile is partnering with lots of different industries to put trackable Tiles into the widest variety of products, such as suitcases, so that "no one ever loses anything again". A user's map on the Tile app shows the last known location of a tracked object and with 15 million Tiles sold, Adusumilli noted that Tile already has the "world's biggest lost and found community". Commenting on the ClarityHDX headphones, Adusumilli said, "[Tile] will be built right into the Monster headphones".</p>
 <p>The ClarityHDX headphones will also feature Monster Talk - Monster's new proprietary voice-activation technology, which will also be rolled out to all of the company's Bluetooth speakers and Elements powered by Melody.</p>
 <p>Lee claims that Monster Talk is much more focused on music than other digital assistants, such as Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa, as it will identify any audio tracks stored on your device, regardless of location or file type, and catalogue them for easy recall and playback. Monster Talk also does not need WiFi, as it is built directly into the headphone or speaker product.</p>
 <p>Building on Monster Talk, the new iSport Victory X wireless sports earbuds will feature the "first four-button remote in the industry" (cue more exhortation for the room to whoop and clap), with the fourth button exclusively dedicated to Monster Talk.</p>
 <p>Lee went on to discuss the issue of true wireless earbuds, calling it "the most exciting failure of consumer electronics" in recent years, reflecting on how they have too often been bulky, expensive, "not very fashionable" and simply didn't sound good enough. "Do you think Monster would take care of the problem?", Lee shouted to the room, twice.</p>
 <p>He then introduced Monster AirLinks - "true wireless redefined". Thre will be two models: one for sport and "one for the fashionistas". Both feature a micro-coil antenna system "for no drop outs". The fitness model will retail at $199; the fashion model at $229. Having handled the earbuds, as they were passed around the audience, they are similar in size and shape to Yevo Labs' Yevo 1 wireless earbuds, albeit with a rounded, palm-sized recharging case (rather than the Yevo 1's rectangular style) and different end-caps for the buds, depending on the style chosen. The fashion model on show here had gold, multi-faceted, jewel-style end caps.    </p>

 <p>At this point, Lee introduced the first of his famous friends and "brand ambassadors". Female rapper Iggy Azalea is the latest name added to the Monster roster and she will be the company face for AirLinks. Walking out onstage in a dark red dress, Azalea declared, "I love Norm. I saw he had rims all the time and I thought, 'This is my kind of guy!'</p>
 <p>"When I met Norm, he said he always liked to test his new equipment with my song 'Fancy'".</p>
 <p>"For me as a girl I hate to put on headphones that are bulky or don't look good. I'm super-excited about what we're going to come up with together."</p>
 <p>As part of their collaboration, Lee mentioned that, "Iggy and Monster are doing a SuperBowl commercial", which Azalea confirmed, saying, "This commercial is going to really special. We're both underdogs and you're going to see that story in this commercial".</p>
 <p>Talking about Monster's product range, in particular its Bluetooth boomboxes, Azalea recalled her childhood in Australia, riding around on her bike with a speaker tied to the front: "Music is missing that communal aspect that we all enjoy together. Noel has recreated the boombox in a way that really works."</p>
 <p>As Azalea left the stage, Lee went on to expand on the new additions and upgrades to the Superstar and Monster Blaster range of Bluetooth boomboxes which Azalea had referenced. The Superstar speakers have a 3D audio speaker system, with an additional middle speaker to create a more expansive soundstage. The $100 Little Monster personal speaker was introduced and demo'ed over the PA system. All Superstars have V-Sound technology, so they should sound the same whether positioned vertically or horizontally. Lee was also keen to stress a specific selling point for Monster's outdoor speakers: "We're waterproof and we float!"</p>
 <p>Bigging up the MonsterBlaster range - "the boombox reimagined" - Lee pulled up a photo of another famous friend: "Stevie Wonder loves his Monster Blaster", with Wonder pictured walking through a crowd carrying his Monster Master Blaster model on his shoulder in the classic old-school hip-hop way.</p>
 <p>The Monster Blaster Black is new, along with the Monster Master Blaster S. There is also a new RaveBox Plus with a five-segment LED and which projects a real laser show so "you can take the rave home". For all of its boomboxes, Monster has created SoftPlay technology to retain deep bass at low volumes.</p>
 <p>In keeping with the old-school boombox feel, Lee introduced the</p>
 <p>MonsterRapCast - a microphone people can "take to the park with your Blaster, the true meaning of what the boombox was designed for in our culture". At this point, hip-hop/R&amp;B dance trio The Tainerz joined Lee on stage to showcase these products.</p>
 <p>Finally, Lee introduced one of his oldest musician friends, Joe Perry of Aerosmith - "Joe and I have been friends for 25 years" - to present the Joe Perry Classic Rock Blaster. Lee recalled how Perry had asked him to create a speaker that was suited to classic rock music, not one tuned more for bass-heavy rap or EDM music, which many Bleutooth speakers are now. "I want it tuned specially for rock music", Lee recounted Perry's request.</p>

 <p>"I'm kind of an amateur engineer, I follow that recording scene," Perry said. "Noel and I have been partners in sound for all those years."</p>
 <p>Describing how he road-tested his signature gold Blaster, Perry explained, "I listened to some of the old classic recordings, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, rock'n'roll, then all through the 60s, and it all sounds great on this thing.</p>
 <p>"We put a bass switch on there to kind of make up for the bass that was sort of lacking on recordings from those days, but it also works out well for modern recordings, too."</p>
 <p>As part of the inspiration for creating a signature model Blaster, Perry shared how many other speakers he has gone through on tour: "We bring something on the road, in two weeks all the knobs break off, the speakers go," he laughed. "I've had this one on the road with me for months. I've had this thing so loud it's shaking the [hotel] walls. It's just an amazing boombox."</p>
 <p>There will also be a slightly smaller version of the Joe Perry Classic Rock Blaster called the Firecracker, which Perry has already been using in the recording studio. "We had one on the desk and we were using it as a reference, to really hear what it was going to sound like".</p>
 <p>All the new Monster products will become available during 2018.</p>
